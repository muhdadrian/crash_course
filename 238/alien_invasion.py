'''
If a KEYDOWN event occurs for the K_LEFT key, we set moving_left to True. If a KEYUP event occurs 
for the K_LEFT key, we set moving_left to False. We can use elif blocks here because each event is
connected to only one key. If the player presses both keys at once, two separate events will be 
detected.

When you run alien_invasion.py now, you should be able to move the ship continuously to the right 
and left. If you hold down both keys, the ship should stop moving.

Next, we’ll further refine the ship’s movement. Let’s adjust the ship’s speed and limit how far 
the ship can move so it can’t disappear off the sides of the screen.
